# RockPaperScissors
Rock Paper Scissors Game!
This is a short game to test my recently acquired knowledge of function usage in python.

The computer will select an "item" at random (rock, paper or scissors).
The user will select an item and the game will compare both selections to determine the winner.

In this small project, I practice the use of conditional statements as well as utlizing the random module. I will also be making use of while loops and practicing using user input!
